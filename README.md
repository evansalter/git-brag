# Git Brag

A python script that prints out the contributions of each author in the project.  Statistics shown are:

- Files changed
- Lines inserted
- Lines deleted

## Requirements

- `git` command line tool must be installed
- Python version 2.7 (check with `python --version`)
- A UNIX OS such as Mac OS X or a Linux distro

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to the directory of your choosing
1. `cd git-brag`
1. `python setup.py install`

Note: If you do not have the privileges to install global packages, replace step 3 with `python setup.py install --user`.  The program will be installed in `~/.local/bin` on UNIX or `~/Library/Python/X.Y` on Mac.

## Usage

While in a git repository, run `brag`

If you want to specify the date range to search in, use the `--start` and `--end` arguments (or `-s` and `-e` for short):

Example:

- `brag -s "one week ago" -e "yesterday"`
- `brag --start "2015-01-04"`
- `brag -s "2015-04-13" --end "two days ago"`

## Testing

I have tested `brag` with a number of repos to ensure stability and to record speed.  I ran the following tests on my 2013 MacBook Pro (i7/16GB RAM/OS X 10.11).  All the tests completed successfully.

### Methodology

1. `git clone` repo and `cd` into it
2. Run `blame` with no arguments.  This makes it report on every single commit since the creation of the repo
3. Using a stopwatch, time how long the program takes to run and output

### Results

|Repository|Number of Contributors|Running Time (mm:ss)|
|---|---|---|
|[django](https://github.com/django)/[django](https://github.com/django/django)|1027|04:46|
|[facebook](https://github.com/facebook)/[flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow)|99|00:16|
|[google](https://github.com/google)/[googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)|20|00:02|

For most projects, speed shouldn't be an issue.

Finally, for readability when running `brag` on large projects (>30 contributors) the graph will only include users that have contributed to at least 0.5% of the inserted lines.

## Demo

Running `brag` on the repo for the awesome Chrome extension “Terrorist to Coward” by [psiemens](https://github.com/psiemens) produces the following:
